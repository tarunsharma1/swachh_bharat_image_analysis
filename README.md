Spatio temporal analysis of garbage distribution using Deep Learning methods


Garbage is detected using a Fast RCNN.
Before - After spot fix detection using fc7 features from a network trained on MIT Places dataset. Got better results than SIFT comparison.

Spatio Temporal heatmap to visualize garbage distribution around the city. 
Code for assigning priority to every dump using Google Places API.
